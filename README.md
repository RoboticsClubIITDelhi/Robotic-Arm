## üöÄ Overview
This repository is intended to manage the codebase for the **Robotics Arm summer project 2025-26** (part of robotics club). It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including code, CAD models, calculations, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.

## üéØ Project Goals
(In continuation with the alredy existing hardware)
- replace all motors with [SC15](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/SC15_Servo)
- use the waveshare SC15 servo drive with esp32 more info [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Servo_Driver_with_ESP32#SC_Servo)
- add a battery powersource (6-12v)
- Redesign the Gripper (will be good if you can upload the final CAD models here as well)
- design the SC15 motor mounts
- Coding part
  - solve the inverse kinematic, (or have atleast a rough estimate via trial and error)
  - make the controlls in cylindrical coordinates `[r, h, œÜ]`.
  - design a UI(web) to controll to wirelessly, (as seen in driver demo)


## üìã Progress 
Need to break each tasks for ease and also distrubute the task day wise.
For now this is just an overview.
### üîß Hardware Upgrades
- [ ] Design motor mounts for SC15 servos
- [ ] Redesign and upload CAD files for the new gripper
- [ ] Replace all motors with SC15 servos
- [ ] Integrate SC15 servo driver with ESP32 
- [ ] Add 6‚Äì12V battery power source


### üß† Software Tasks
- [ ] Implement inverse kinematics (approximate solution acceptable)
- [ ] Develop cylindrical coordinate-based controls `[r, h, œÜ]`
- [ ] Build a basic web UI for wireless control (refer to Waveshare demo)
